- **Specification:**
1 m (60 LED beads)
- **Alloy Wire:**
Compared to pure metals, alloys generally have higher strength and hardness. This makes the alloy wire more durable, not easy to break or deform. Alloy wires like copper-nickel alloy wire, silver-nickel alloy wire, etc., all have good conductivity, allowing the current to pass smoothly. Many alloys have good oxidation resistance and are not easy to rust or corrode when exposed to air. Generally, alloy wires have good thermal stability and can maintain their physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures.
- **Brass Bracket:**
Brass, a widely used alloy composed mainly of copper and zinc, has good mechanical properties, that is, good strength and hardness, enabling it to withstand larger loads and impacts. At the same time, it has excellent corrosion resistance, can resist corrosion under various environmental conditions, including air, water, and many chemicals, and is easy to process, with good plasticity and toughness, making it easy to cut, weld, and shape. This makes the brass bracket easily made into various shapes and sizes.
- **PVC Plastic:**
Commonly used to make cable sheaths. PVC is a wear-resistant, corrosion-resistant material and has good insulation properties, which can prevent short circuits or electric shocks.
**Therefore, these characteristics can make the entire device have a stable and high-quality lighting performance.**

### <font size="3"><h3 style="color: #e19cab;">3.Pure Copper Transparent Electric Wire:</h3></font>
- **Specification:**
2Ã—0.3 square; Length 10m (Wire core material: Tin-plated copper)
- Tin-plated copper wire is made by plating a layer of tin on the surface of the copper wire. This material combines the advantages of copper and tin and has excellent electrical conductivity. The tin layer on its surface can prevent the copper wire from contacting the air, thus preventing oxidation. This makes the life of tin-plated copper wire longer and the performance more stable. And tin is a very stable metal, not easily corroded by acid or alkali. Therefore, tin-plated copper wire has good corrosion resistance in various environments. The tin layer can also improve the welding performance of the copper wire, making welding easier and the connection more solid. At the same time, due to the protection of the tin layer, the tin-plated copper wire can maintain good performance in high temperature, humidity or other harsh environments, thereby extending its service life. 
**Therefore, using pure copper wires can better ensure the safe connection of the entire circuit.**

### <font size="3"><h3 style="color: #e19cab;">4.ergo.8500UV Shadowless Adhesive:</h3></font>
- **Specification:**
 ergo.8500 (Strong Adhesive)
- This is a special adhesive, mainly used for the bonding of various materials. It can cure quickly under the irradiation of ultraviolet light, so it is widely used in applications that require quick curing and high bonding strength. The main ingredients of this glue usually include resin, photoinitiator, and other additives. The resin is the main body of the glue, determining its basic bonding performance; the photoinitiator can initiate the polymerization reaction of the resin under the irradiation of ultraviolet light, making the glue cure quickly; other additives can improve various properties of the glue, such as improving its heat resistance, weather resistance, etc.The main advantages of ergo.8500UV shadowless glue are fast curing speed, high bonding strength, good transparency.
**So it can better bond materials such as wires to the entire device.**

- Cold-rolled steel is a type of steel processed by cold rolling. Compared with hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel plate has more precise thickness and smoother and more beautiful surface. The cold rolling process increases the hardness of the steel, improves its strength, while reducing its toughness and plasticity. Under this process, cold-rolled steel can be formed by various cold rolling shape machines, producing various complex shapes. However, because the cold rolling process is more complicated than the hot rolling process, the production cost is relatively higher, so the price of cold-rolled steel is usually higher than that of hot-rolled steel. Its good mechanical properties and process performance make it widely used in multiple fields such as automobiles, home appliances, construction, and mechanical manufacturing.
**Therefore, in this device, we use its smooth, low-resistance feature as a tool to drive the cloth to rotate.**

- The high elasticity of the rubber material allows the friction wheel to provide good grip when contacting the surface, and it can quickly recover to its original state after being subjected to pressure. At the same time, good wear resistance to resist long-term friction and wear during rotation. Its damping performance can reduce the vibration and noise of the motor during operation, improving the stability of the equipment. During the operation of the motor, a large amount of heat may be generated, and rubber has good heat resistance to prevent performance degradation or damage due to high temperature. 
**Therefore, in the device, the roulette is driven to rotate by the rubber friction wheel.**
